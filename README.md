### Hi there, welcome to my humble repo, there is nothing much here, but you know, I always try to keep up to date and do some coding exercises and finish some apps that I believe can add some value. ðŸ‘‹

Got these ideas below as a start:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on asset management microservices application and also improving my rotagen.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Spring, Cassandra, Kafka and many other things, everyday is a learning day.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on opensource projects.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything you want in Software Management and Development.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Try email, if not, keep trying email.. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: Black belt in BJJ, also I am Brazillian, but the real fun fact is my favourite food. Of course, Strognoff!

I started my career in 1999 and since then has been a long journey, I never stopped to learn and also evolve, so that's life, constant challenges.
