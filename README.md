### Hi there, welcome to my humble repo, there is nothing much here, but you know, I always try to keep up to date and do some coding exercises and finish some apps that I believe can add some value. 👋

Got these ideas below as a start:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Java Applications along with React/Typescript/Javascript.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Spring, Cassandra, Kafka, React and many other things, everyday is a learning day.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects.
- 💬 Ask me about anything you want in Software Management and Development.
- 📫 How to reach me: Try email, if not, keep trying email.. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: Black belt in BJJ, also I am Brazilian, but the real fun fact is my favourite food. Of course, Strognoff!

I started my career in 1999, and since then it has been a long journey. I never stopped to learn and evolving, so that's life, constant challenges.
